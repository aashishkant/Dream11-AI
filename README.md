1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required packages using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

2. **Specify Teams and Fantasy Points**: Define the players and their fantasy points for each team in the provided code.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to generate the final predicted team:

   python dream11_ai.py
   ```

4. **View Results**: The script will output the final predicted team along with the selected captain and vice-captain.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Dream11 AI Predictor:

```python
# Specify the teams
team1 = ['Player1', 'Player2', ...]
team2 = ['PlayerA', 'PlayerB', ...]

# Get the final predicted team
final_predicted_team = get_final_predicted_team(team1, team2, team1_fp, team2_fp)

# Choose captain and vice-captain
captain, vice_captain = choose_captain_and_vice_captain(final_predicted_team)

# Print the final predicted team along with captain and vice-captain
print('Final Predicted Team:', final_predicted_team)
